## About

Relay is a self-hostable, hackable LLM web environment that can be extended
with your own tools and skills that live in your `${HOME}` directory.
It is for programmers, AI engineers, hackers, and anyone who wants
their own AI environment with the option to extend it with code.


## Setup

It is simple to setup and get started. The application is
distributed as a RubyGem. It has a minimal set of dependencies -
built on Roda, Sequel, Falcon, [llm.rb](https://github.com/llmrb/llm.rb),
HTMX and web sockets.

## Getting started

#### Install

Install the gem

```sh
gem install relay.app
```

#### Configure

Interactive setup

```sh
relay setup
```

#### Serve

Start the server, and visit http://localhost:9292

```sh
relay start
```

## Tools

#### How do I add my own tool?

Before running `relay start` you should add `~/.config/relay/tools/<yourtool>.rb`.
The tool will be automatically made available to the LLM. This is how a tool
might look - it is not very useful because it does not emit command output
but it serves as a simple example that you can modify and change to meet
your requirements:

```ruby
class Shell < LLM::Tool
  name "shell"
  description "Run a shell command"
  parameter :command, String, "The command to run"
  parameter :arguments, Array[String], "The command arguments"
  required %i[command]

  def call(command:, arguments:)
    {ok: system(command, *arguments)}
  end
end
```

#### Wait, what is a tool?

A tool contains a name, a description, and optional parameters. It is attached
to a method, and that method that can be called. The model or LLM decides when
and how to call a tool. A tool can do anything you can imagine, and it can extend
the abilities of the LLM. Suddenly a LLM can search the web, run code, and anything
you can think of. They're a powerful way to extend the capabilities of an LLM.

An MCP server can also expose pre-packaged tools, and those can be especially
powerful for talking to GitHub or your own Forgejo instance.

### What are the default tools?

The `relay-knowledge` tool returns documentation for both Relay
and [llm.rb](https://github.com/llmrb/llm.rb) - ask about either
of those, and you will be able to have an informed conversation
about both. Good for learning how to use llm.rb, and write your
own tools.

There is also a set of tools that manage a playlist of songs that
can be played inline in the chat, and you can also add your own
songs or remove existing ones through the same tools. The only
requirement is that it is a YouTube URL.

## Costs

#### What provider is the best value?

DeepSeek. <br>
Hard to beat it on price. <br>
Recent models have a context window of 1M.

#### What about self-hosting with Ollama ?

[llm.rb](https://github.com/llmrb/llm.rb#readme) provides support ollama, llama.cpp,
and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. But Relay does not surface it as a feature. I haven't
had the time or resources to setup either ollama or llamacpp locally.
